The clean and minimalistic approach not only enhances the overall aesthetics but also ensures that the information is easily comprehensible for the audience. By incorporating these design elements, we aim to create a visually cohesive and impactful presentation that effectively communicates the brand's message.",

To maintain brand consistency, I carefully selected orange, red, and green as the main theme colours, which are derived from the vibrant packaging of Captain Softmeal.

Through our idents, we aim to captivate audiences and create a lasting impression that reflects our innovative and futuristic approach. By infusing elements of technology and imagination, we strive to carve a distinct identity in the realm of visual storytelling.",

Hence, it is crucial for the theme of the slogans to align with the movie's narrative. 'The Sorcerer's Adventure' is a  sci-fi film centred around a Chinese sorcerer and his lover who are kidnapped by a villain. To enhance the trailer's impact, I designed two distinct themes: the Clock theme and the Stormy theme. The Clock theme symbolises a sense of urgency and nervous anticipation, while the Stormy theme represents the impending conflict and heightened emotions of war. These thematic choices aim to captivate the audience and effectively convey the movie's essence.",
