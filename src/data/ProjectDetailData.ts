Moreover, creating a dedicated 'Blog' page instead of relying on external social media account would allow the company, specialising in IT services and consulting for mobile apps and websites, to demonstrate their professionalism, technical expertise, and build customer trust.

Job descriptions have been expanded to offer detailed insights to potential new talents. Additionally, the 'About Us' page allows interested individuals to view the company's background and information. These improvements aim to create a more attractive and informative 'Career' page, enhancing the company's ability to attract and engage prospective candidates.",
